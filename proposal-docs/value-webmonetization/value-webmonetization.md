# Web Monetization using `<podcast:value/>`

To enable and promote Web Monetization (WM) in podcasting, necessary information for WM could be provided for a podcast by adding a `<podcast:value/>` tag to the RSS feed.
  https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md

This `value` tag would have the following values for use with Web Monetization:
```xml
<podcast:value 
    type="webmonetization" 
    method="ILP"
></podcast:value>
```

The `podcast:value.type` defines the cryptocurrency or protocol layer, which in this case is used to define Web Monetization payment information, using the value of `webmonetization`.

The `method` of `ILP` specifies the use of [Interledger  Protocol (ILP)](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0027-interledger-protocol-4/) which is the protocol for payment providers in WM.

Within the `podcast:value` tag we also need to designate recipients. In Web Monetization, payment info is discovered using the [Simple Payment Setup Protocol](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0009-simple-payment-setup-protocol) with which the [Open Payments](https://docs.openpayments.dev/web-monetization) protocol is designed to be [backwards compatible](https://docs.openpayments.dev/web-monetization#backwards-compatibility-with-spsp).

Both SPSP and Open Payments use a recipient address in the form of a [Payment Pointer](https://github.com/interledger/rfcs/blob/master/0026-payment-pointers/0026-payment-pointers.md) which will be provided in the `address` attribute, with the `type` of `paymentpointer`.

```xml
<podcast:value 
    type="webmonetization" 
    method="ILP"
>
    <podcast:valueRecipient
        name="Alice"
        type="paymentpointer"
        address="$example.now/~alice"
        split="100"
    >
</podcast:value>
```

While payments in WM are streamed to a single payment pointer at a time, the WM authors suggest splits can be implemented using [Probabilistic Revenue Sharing](https://webmonetization.org/docs/probabilistic-rev-sharing) or perhaps for WM should be [implemented at the payment pointer](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/issues/132#issuecomment-780145285) rather than expecting the client to be responsible.  In either case, the `podcast:value` and `podcast:valueRecipient` tags can provide sufficient information for a web player or page to setup Web Monetization for the podcast.
